## 🛠️ Tech stack

- **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Material 3**
- **MVVM** architecture
- **Room** (SQLite) with proper schema **migrations**
- **Navigation Compose**, **Coil** image loading
- **Kotlin Coroutines / Flow**
- **JUnit** unit tests for core logic

### Architecture

```
UI (Compose screens)
      │   observes StateFlow
ViewModel (MVVM)  ──►  Repository  ──►  Room DAO / SQLite
```

Each screen renders immutable UI state exposed by a ViewModel; the ViewModel talks to a repository that wraps Room, so data flows one way and the UI stays reactive.
